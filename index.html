            <div class="topic-texts">My journey into using technology to empower underrepresented teens in education stems from my own experiences. Growing up as first generation college student that migrated from Greece when I was only 6, I witnessed firsthand how access to quality education can transform lives. Now, as a dedicated technologist, my mission is to leverage innovative technologies to provide free, accessible education to teens who may not have had these opportunities otherwise. By creating intuitive platforms and leveraging digital tools, I aim to bridge educational gaps and empower future generations to thrive in a rapidly evolving world.</div>
